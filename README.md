# FASTQC
FastQC is a genetic sequence quality verification program produced by the Babraham Institute in the UK, with quality control for high throughput sequences. The program reads the sequence data in various formats, performs several different QC checks, and produces the results as HTML-based reports. It provides both a GUI-based usage environment and a console-based execution environment.
